A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Darkvenom/pen/MymQZw.

 Uses all CSS transitions for animation. Collision detection could use a little work. Definitely not built for performance, but it was a fun little exercise.

Forked from [Mark E. Carter](http://codepen.io/mecarter/)'s Pen [Spaceship shooter game](http://codepen.io/mecarter/pen/BnpsD/).
